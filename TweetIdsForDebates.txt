We will tweet at certain times so we can get tweet ids to help limit our timeframe

Query: https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/user_timeline.json?user_id=GOPPredictors

t0 since id = from tweet on Wed 11:30pm est 
t1 max id = tweet from around 8:30pm Thurs est (= debate start)

t2 tweet at debate end
t3 tweet at day after debate end

max queries * tweets per query = max # of tweets we want to process

2 days x 3 people x 24 hrs / 1 x 60 min/ 1 x 1 batch / 15 min x 450 tweets/ 1 batch = 

goal: 20k before and after on each query (prefiltered)
